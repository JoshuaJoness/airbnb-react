Had to change res.data.token to res.data on Signup page, at the axios post request to POST signup in order to be able to get the token... why? not sure.

places that I am hosting, will display locally but not on heroku. It seems like it cannot connect to the API backend POST getHosting
-NOW it's working, just had to merge branches
